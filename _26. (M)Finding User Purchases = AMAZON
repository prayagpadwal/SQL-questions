QUESTION:
Finding User Purchases
Write a query that'll identify returning active users. A returning active user is a user that has made a second purchase within 7 days of any other of their purchases. Output a list of user_ids of these returning active users.

ANSWER:
SELECT DISTINCT
    (a1.user_id)
FROM 
    amazon_transactions a1
JOIN 
    amazon_transactions a2
ON 
    a1.user_id = a2.user_id 
    AND a1.id <> a2.id
    AND a2.created_at::date - a1.created_at::date BETWEEN 0 and 7
ORDER BY 
    a1.user_id;
